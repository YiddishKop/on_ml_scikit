#+TITLE: Cross-Validation and scoring methods


* Cross-Validation and scoring methods

In the previous sections and notebooks, we split our dataset into two parts, a
training set and a test set. We used the training set to fit our model, and we
used the test set to evaluate its generalization performance -- how well it
performs on new, unseen data. ​ ​

However, often (labeled) data is precious, and this approach lets us only use ~
3/4 of our data for training. On the other hand, we will only ever try to apply
our model 1/4 of our data for testing. A common way to use more of the data to
build a model, but also get a more robust estimate of the generalization
performance, is *cross-validation*.

In cross-validation, the data is split repeatedly into a training and
non-overlapping test-sets, with a separate model built for every pair. The
test-set scores are then aggregated for a more robust estimate.

The most common way to do cross-validation is *k-fold cross-validation*, in
which the data is first *split into k (often 5 or 10) equal-sized folds*, and
then for each iteration, *one of the k folds is used as test data, and the rest
as training data*:

This way, each data point will be in the test-set exactly once, and we can use
all but a k'th of the data for training. Let us apply this technique to evaluate
the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm on the Iris dataset:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
  iris = load_iris()
  X, y = iris.data, iris.target
  print(X.shape, y.shape)
  classifier = KNeighborsClassifier()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[354]:
:END:

The labels in iris are sorted, which means that if we split the data as
illustrated above, the first fold will only have the label 0 in it, while the
last one will only have the label 2:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[346]:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
  2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
  2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
#+END_EXAMPLE
:END:

To avoid this problem in evaluation, we first shuffle our data:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
permutation = rng.permutation(len(X))
X, y = X[permutation], y[permutation]
print(y)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[347]:
:END:

Now implementing cross-validation is easy:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
k = 5
n_samples = len(X)
fold_size = n_samples // k
scores = []
masks = []
for fold in range(k):
    # generate a boolean mask for the test set in this fold
    test_mask = np.zeros(n_samples, dtype=bool)
    test_mask[fold * fold_size : (fold + 1) * fold_size] = True
    # store the mask for visualization
    masks.append(test_mask)
    # create training and test sets using this mask
    X_test, y_test = X[test_mask], y[test_mask]
    X_train, y_train = X[~test_mask], y[~test_mask]
    # fit the classifier
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # compute the score and record it
    scores.append(classifier.score(X_test, y_test))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[348]:
:END:

Let's check that our test mask does the right thing:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.matshow(masks, cmap='gray_r')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[353]:
: <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x7f9c3281ac50>
[[file:./obipy-resources/250412lK.png]]
:END:

And now let's look a the scores we computed:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
print(scores)
print(np.mean(scores))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[350]:
:END:


As you can see, there is a rather wide spectrum of scores from 90% correct to
100% correct. If we only did a single split, we might have gotten either answer.

As cross-validation is such a common pattern in machine learning, there are
functions to do the above for you with much more flexibility and less code. The
~sklearn.model_selection~ module has all functions related to cross validation.
There easiest function is ~cross_val_score~ which takes an estimator and a
dataset, and will do all of the splitting for you:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(classifier, X, y)
print(scores)
print(np.mean(scores))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[355]:
:END:

As you can see, the function uses three folds by default. You can change the
number of folds using the cv argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
cross_val_score(classifier, X, y, cv=5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[352]:
: array([ 1.  ,  0.93,  1.  ,  1.  ,  0.93])
:END:

There are also helper objects in the cross-validation module that will generate
indices for you for all kinds of different cross-validation methods, including
k-fold:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, StratifiedKFold, ShuffleSplit
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[357]:
:END:

*** 3 methods to decide parameter 'cv'
    we will use ~cv.split(train_set, test_set)~ to split dataset into folds
    - ShuffleSplit
    - KFold
    - StratifiedKFold <<< for unbalanced data


    >>> how to choose classifier for unbalanced dataset
By default, ~cross_val_score~ will use ~StratifiedKFold~ for classification,
which ensures that the class proportions in the dataset are reflected in each
fold.

If you have a binary classification dataset with *90% of data point belonging to
class 0*, that would mean that in each fold, 90% of datapoints would belong to
class 0. If you would just use KFold cross-validation, *it is likely that you
would generate a split that only contains class 0*. It is generally a good idea
to use ~StratifiedKFold~ whenever you do classification.

StratifiedKFold would also remove our need to shuffle iris. Let's see what kinds
of folds it generates on the unshuffled iris dataset. Each cross-validation
class is a generator of sets of training and test indices:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)
for train, test in cv.split(iris.data, iris.target):
    print(test)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[358]:
:END:

As you can see, there are a couple of samples from the beginning, then from the
middle, and then from the end, in each of the folds. This way, the class ratios
are preserved. Let's visualize the split:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
def plot_cv(cv, features, labels):
    masks = []
    for train, test in cv.split(features, labels):
        mask = np.zeros(len(labels), dtype=bool)
        mask[test] = 1
        masks.append(mask)

    plt.matshow(masks, cmap='gray_r')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[359]:
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_cv(StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5), iris.data, iris.target)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[360]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/25041DwQ.png]]
:END:

For comparison, again the standard KFold, that ignores the labels:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_cv(KFold(n_splits=5), iris.data, iris.target)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[361]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/25041Q6W.png]]
:END:

Keep in mind that increasing the number of folds will give you a larger training
dataset, but will lead to more repetitions, and therefore a slower evaluation:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_cv(KFold(n_splits=10), iris.data, iris.target)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[362]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/25041dEd.png]]
:END:

Another helpful cross-validation generator is ShuffleSplit. This generator
simply splits of a random portion of the data repeatedly. This allows the user
to specify the number of repetitions and the training set size independently:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_cv(ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=.2), iris.data, iris.target)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[363]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/25041qOj.png]]
:END:

If you want a more robust estimate, you can just increase the number of splits:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_cv(ShuffleSplit(n_splits=20, test_size=.2), iris.data, iris.target)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[364]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/250413Yp.png]]
:END:

You can use all of these cross-validation generators with the cross_val_score
method:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=.2)
cross_val_score(classifier, X, y, cv=cv)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[365]:
: array([ 0.97,  0.97,  0.97,  0.93,  0.93])
:END:

EXERCISE: Perform three-fold cross-validation using the KFold class on the iris
dataset without shuffling the data. Can you explain the result?
