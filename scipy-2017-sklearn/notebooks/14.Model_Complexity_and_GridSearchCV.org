* Parameter selection, Validation, and Testing
** bias variance tradeoff
Most models have parameters that influence how complex a model they can learn.
Remember using KNeighborsRegressor. If we change the number of neighbors we
consider, we get a smoother and smoother prediction:


file:figures/plot_kneigbors_regularization.png

In the above figure, we see fits for three different values of n_neighbors:

 - For n_neighbors=2, the data is overfit, the model is too flexible and can
   adjust too much to the noise in the training data.

 - For n_neighbors=20, the model is not flexible enough, and can not model the
   variation in the data appropriately.

 - For n_neighbors = 5, we have found a good mid-point. It fits the
data fairly well, and does not suffer from the overfit or underfit problems seen
in the figures on either side.


What we would like is *a way to quantitatively identify overfit and underfit*,
and optimize the hyperparameters (in this case, the polynomial degree d) in
order to determine the best algorithm.

We trade off between:

 - remembering too much about the particularities and noise of the training data
 - not modeling enough of the variability.

This is a trade-off that needs to be made in basically every machine learning
application and is a central concept, called *bias-variance-tradeoff* or
"overfitting vs underfitting".

​
** Hyperparameters, Over-fitting, and Under-fitting

Unfortunately, there is no general rule how to find the sweet spot, and so
machine learning practitioners have to find the best trade-off of
*model-complexity* and *generalization* by *trying* several *hyperparameter*
settings.

Hyperparameters are the internal knobs or tuning parameters of a machine
learning algorithm (in contrast to model parameters that the algorithm learns
from the training data -- for example, the weight coefficients of a linear
regression model); the number of *k in K-nearest neighbors* is such a
*hyperparameter*.

Most commonly this "*hyperparameter tuning*" is done using a *brute force
search*, for example over multiple values of n_neighbors:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
# generate toy dataset:
x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
y = np.sin(4 * x) + x + rng.normal(size=len(x))
X = x[:, np.newaxis]
cv = KFold(shuffle=True)
# for each parameter setting do cross-validation:
for n_neighbors in [1, 3, 5, 10, 20]:
    scores = cross_val_score(KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=n_neighbors), X, y, cv=cv)
    print("n_neighbors: %d, average score: %f" % (n_neighbors, np.mean(scores)))

There is a function in scikit-learn, called *validation_plot* to reproduce the
cartoon figure above. It plots one parameter, such as the number of neighbors,
against training and validation error (using cross-validation):

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve
n_neighbors = [1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50]
train_scores, test_scores = validation_curve(KNeighborsRegressor(), X, y, param_name="n_neighbors",
                                             param_range=n_neighbors, cv=cv)
plt.plot(n_neighbors, train_scores.mean(axis=1), 'b', label="train accuracy")
plt.plot(n_neighbors, test_scores.mean(axis=1), 'g', label="test accuracy")
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Number of neighbors')
plt.xlim([50, 0])
plt.legend(loc="best");

:END:

Note that many neighbors mean a "smooth" or "simple" model, so the plot uses a
reverted x axis.

If multiple parameters are important, like the parameters ~C~ and ~gamma~ in an
~SVM~ (more about that later), all *possible combinations are tried*:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.svm import SVR
# each parameter setting do cross-validation:
for C in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]:
    for gamma in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]:
        scores = cross_val_score(SVR(C=C, gamma=gamma), X, y, cv=cv)
        print("C: %f, gamma: %f, average score: %f" % (C, gamma, np.mean(scores)))

:END:

As this is such a very common pattern, there is a built-in class for this in
scikit-learn, ~GridSearchCV~. GridSearchCV takes a dictionary that describes the
parameters that should be tried and a model to train.

The grid of parameters is defined as a *dictionary*, where the keys are the
parameters and the values are the settings to be tested.

One of the great things about ~GridSearchCV~ is that it is a *meta-estimator*.
It takes an estimator like SVR above, and creates a new estimator, that behaves
exactly the same - in this case, like a regressor. So *we can call fit on it, to
train it*:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
grid.fit(X, y)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

# Out[370]:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  error_score='raise',
  estimator=SVR(C=1.0, cache_size=200, coef0=0.0, degree=3, epsilon=0.1, gamma='auto',
  kernel='rbf', max_iter=-1, shrinking=True, tol=0.001, verbose=False),
  fit_params=None, iid=True, n_jobs=1,
  param_grid={'C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], 'gamma': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]},
  pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, return_train_score=True,
  scoring=None, verbose=3)
#+END_EXAMPLE
:END:

What fit does is a bit more involved then what we did above.

  - First, it runs the same loop with cross-validation, to find the best
    parameter combination.

  - Once it has the best combination, it runs fit again on all data passed to
    fit (without cross-validation), to built a single new model using the best
    parameter setting.

Then, as with all models, we can use predict or score:

You can inspect the best parameters found by GridSearchCV in the best_params_
attribute, and the best score in the best_score_ attribute:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
print(grid.best_score_)

But you can investigate the performance and much more for each set of parameter
values by accessing the ~cv_results_~ attributes. The ~cv_results_~ attribute is
a dictionary where each key is a string and each value is array. It can
therefore be used to make a pandas DataFrame.

>>> why we need validation set: hypothesis teseting error.
There is a problem with using this score for evaluation, however. You might be
making what is called a multiple *hypothesis testing error*.

If you try very many parameter settings, some of them will work better just by
chance, and the score that you obtained might not reflect how your model would
perform on new unseen data. *Therefore, it is good to split off a separate
test-set before performing grid-search*. This pattern can be seen as a
*training-validation-test* split, and is common in machine learning:

file:figures/grid_search_cross_validation.png

We can do this very easily by splitting of some test data using
~train_test_split~, training ~GridSearchCV~ on the *training set*, and applying
the score method to the test set:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)
param_grid = {'C': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], 'gamma': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]}
cv = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True)
grid = GridSearchCV(SVR(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=cv)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
grid.score(X_test, y_test)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

# Out[377]:
: 0.7262035177984737

We can also look at the parameters that were selected:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer

#+END_SRC

# Out[378]:

:END:

Some practitioners go for an easier scheme, splitting the data simply into three
parts, training, validation and testing. This is a possible alternative if your
training set is very large, or it is infeasible to train many models using
cross-validation because training a model takes very long. You can do this with
scikit-learn for example by splitting of a test-set and then applying
GridSearchCV with ShuffleSplit cross-validation with a single iteration: ​

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, ShuffleSplit
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

single_split_cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=1)
grid = GridSearchCV(SVR(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=single_split_cv, verbose=3)

worse results.
